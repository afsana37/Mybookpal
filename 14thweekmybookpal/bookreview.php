<h2>The power of Habit</h2>
<p>In The Power of Habit, Pulitzer Prize–winning business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. Distilling vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives that take us from the boardrooms of Procter & Gamble to sidelines of the NFL to the front lines of the civil rights movement, Duhigg presents a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential. At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, being more productive, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. As Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.</p>

<p>The Power of Habit recounts a number of useful illustrations of the role of habits in individuals, organizations, and societies, and follows up with practical techniques to recognize and consciously direct the things that really control our behavior and our results. The power of habit is the ability to automate willpower, turning a painfully scarce resource into an infinite one. Put this book’s subject matter into practice, and the change in your results will be profound.</p>

<h2>Sherlock holmes</h2>
<p>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a compilation of twelve short Sherlock Holmes stories that was published on October 31st, 1892 and written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The character, Sherlock Holmes, was previously introduced to the world in a novel called A Study in Scarlet, in a Christmas 'annual.'</p>

 <p>Sherlock Holmes is probably the most well-known and loved fictional detective in literature. It's interesting to note that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle actually modeled his famous detective after an associate, Dr. Joseph Bell. Dr. Bell had a long, thin nose - much as we picture Sherlock Holmes - and was very observant. He also used strong deductive skills. </p>

<h2>How to Win Friends and Influence People</h2>
<p>Summary of How to Win Friends and Influence People
December 1, 2012 by William Eden · 1 Comment


 

How to Win Friends and Influence People is a classic book by Dale Carnegie with a pretty self-explanatory title. I read this book recently, and was surprised to find that it epitomized a lot of the wisdom I had already picked up from a variety of other sources. Note that this summary is from the revised 1981 edition, which removed the sections on writing good business letters and achieving marital satisfaction. </p>
<p>How to Win Friends and Influence People is one of the first best-selling self-help books ever published. Written by Dale Carnegie (1888–1955) and first published in 1936, it has sold over 30 million copies world-wide, and went on to be named #19 on Time Magazine's list of 100 most influential books in 2011.[1  </p>
